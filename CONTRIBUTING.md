## Key Components

### AppDelegate
- Handles UI and user interactions
- Manages application lifecycle
- Shows notifications and permission dialogs

### KeyboardBlocker
- Implements CGEventTap for keyboard interception
- Manages accessibility permissions
- Handles event filtering

### Build System
- `build.sh`: Compiles app and creates DMG
- `install.sh`: Local installation helper
- GitHub Actions: Automated CI/CD

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing
1. **Basic functionality**:
   - App launches successfully
   - UI displays correctly
   - Keyboard blocking works
   - Unlock functionality works

2. **Permission handling**:
   - First-run permission request
   - Graceful handling of denied permissions
   - Proper error messages

3. **Edge cases**:
   - App behavior when permissions are revoked
   - Multiple instances of the app
   - System sleep/wake cycles

### Automated Testing
- GitHub Actions run on all PRs
- Build verification on macOS latest
- DMG creation validation

## Release Process

1. **Version updates** are handled via Git tags
2. **GitHub Actions** automatically:
   - Build the application
   - Create DMG and ZIP artifacts
   - Generate release notes
   - Publish to GitHub Releases
